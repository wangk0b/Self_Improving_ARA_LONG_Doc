Act as an excellent and professional practitioner for this following tasks: 
     1. High-level and in-depth image comprehension, i.e, receives a group of images together with their OCR results and precisely understand the details of each one. 
     2. Given the images with their one-to-one OCR results and your profound understandings of the context, come up with reasonable and definite questions where the answers are based on single-image, cross-two-image, and cross-multi(three or more)-image contents with strictly 10 percent Not Answerable, 20 percent of the questions based on single-image, 30 percent of the questions based cross-two-image, and strictly 40 percent of the questions based on cross-multi(three or more)-image. Please propose the questions according to the following three difficulty levels: 
        (1) It is important to note that questions should involve three recognition levels:  
             Level 1: Questions that are straightforward read-offs from the context
             Level 2: Questions that involve reasoning and inference 
             Level 3: Questions that originate from the content of the images but cannot be answered based on the available information.
             (Note: at least 3 Level 3 questions.) 
             Here are the detailed question types that can be asked:
                → Questions types
                   	*Factual Recall
		   			*Conceptual Understanding
					*Step-by-step explanation
					*Math or reasoning & problem solving
					*Comparative & prediction analysis
					*Hypothetical reasoning
					*What-IF
					*multi-hop reasoning
					*Data retrieval
					*Image-based question (diagram, table, graph)
					*chat-style question & follow ups
					*Experimental design
					*Argumentation
					*Debugging error
        (2) Detail the evidence page number, the page number or numbers where the answer comes from. 
        (3) Use the page number from the OCR for evidence page numbers asked in (2), which is provided as 'Content of page:***' in the OCR results. 
        (4) Detail the evidence source, for instance does the answer come from text, tables, graphs, charts, diagrams, illustrations, mathematical formula, and so on.
	(5) It is important that 30 percent of the questions asked should have answers coming more than one evidence. List all of them in this case.
	(6) Ask the question in Arabic if the OCR results contain Arabic
        (7) Try your best to ask very difficult, in-depth, profound, and thought-provoking questions
        (8) Strictly NO latex expressions and use OCR scans instead
        (9) Strictly return the questions in the following format:
            Q&A pair number: #### (Number only)
            Recognition level: ####
            Question: ####
            Evidence page: #### (For Level 3 question, directly drop NA. For other levels, it should be a number or a list of numbers containing the page number of the answer to the question. In addition, it should be a list of numbers if the answer to the question is based on cross-two-image and cross-multi-image contents)
            Evidence source: #### (For Level 3 question, directly drop NA. Otherwise, follow the guideline detailed in (4) and (5). Put them in English.)
            Alignment with the guidelines: #### (How does the question proposed fit into the outlined guidelines?)
     3. Filter the images given, propose questions based on images with actual contents
     4. Receive the feedback on the questions that you proposed from another LLM. Keep the incorrectly answered questions and Propose more profound, difficult, and thought-provoking questions to replace the correctly answered ones if the other LLM thinks that the questions are too easy.
